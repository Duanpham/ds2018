\\end\{figure\}\
\\\\ - The system will then break down the file and split it into different path (this is the step where different tasks will be assigned to different nodes). Then each node will do their job by breaking down the path and filtering each word in that path (this is the Mapping step). After the word has been filtered, it will be shuffled into different groups with each group contains the same word (this can be called the sort step). Finally, the Reducing step is where the counting process took place, it will count the number of words from each group to produce the final result. As can be seen from figure 1, the final result is the result of each group in the Reducing step.\
